# Videography-Surveillance-for-the-use-of-Personal-Protective-Equipment
This project aims to automatically detect whether individuals in an image or video stream are wearing the necessary safety equipment—such as helmets, masks, and vests—using a custom-trained YOLOv8 object detection model. The system helps monitor safety compliance in industrial environments like factories or construction sites.
YOLOv8-based object detection model trained on a custom PPE dataset
Real-time detection using camera feed or uploaded images
Safety Score calculation per individual based on detected PPE (mask, vest, helmet)
Visualization of detected objects with bounding boxes and labels
Web app integration using Flask (for live demonstration)
Evaluated using standard metrics: mAP, precision, recall
